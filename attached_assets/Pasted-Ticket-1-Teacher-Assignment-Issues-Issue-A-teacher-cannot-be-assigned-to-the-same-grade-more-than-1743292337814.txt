Ticket 1: Teacher Assignment Issues
Issue:

A teacher cannot be assigned to the same grade more than once.

Expected Behavior:

A teacher should be able to be assigned to the same grade multiple times if needed.

Steps to Reproduce:

Go to the admin panel → Assign Teacher to Grade.

Assign a teacher to a specific grade.

Try to assign the same teacher to the same grade again.

Fix:

Update the logic to allow multiple assignments of a teacher to the same grade.

Ensure that existing assignments do not block new assignments for the same grade.

Ticket 2: Subject Assignment Dropdown Issue
Issue:

When assigning a subject to a teacher, the assigned grades do not appear in the dropdown.

Expected Behavior:

The dropdown should display all grades the teacher is already assigned to, allowing selection when assigning a subject.

Steps to Reproduce:

Go to the admin panel → Assign Teacher to Subject.

Select a teacher who is already assigned to one or more grades.

Check the dropdown for grades; it does not show assigned grades.

Fix:

Ensure that the system fetches and displays the teacher's assigned grades in the dropdown when assigning a subject.

Verify that the filtering logic correctly maps subjects to available grades.

Ticket 3: Weekly Plan Visibility
Issue:

No clear way to view the weekly plan on the website.

Expected Behavior:

Admin should have a dedicated section to view all weekly plans.

Fix:

Add a weekly plan view section accessible from the admin panel.

Display all previous and active weekly plans in a structured format.
